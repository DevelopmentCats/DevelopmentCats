This is a significant security improvement that affects how users authenticate with the CLI, but it's not currently documented in the session/token documentation.\n\n**Pages to update:**\n- `docs/admin/users/sessions-tokens.md` - Add a section explaining keyring storage\n- `docs/install/cli.md` - Mention keyring storage in CLI authentication section (if appropriate)\n- Potentially add troubleshooting guidance for users experiencing keyring issues\n\n**Key information to include:**\n- Default behavior: tokens stored in OS keyring on macOS/Windows (enabled by default as of v2.29.0)\n- How to opt-out: Use `--use-keyring=false` flag\n- Environment variable: `CODER_USE_KEYRING`\n- When file-based storage is used: when `--global-config` is set, or on platforms without keyring support\n- Security benefits of keyring storage over plain text files\n- Migration note: existing plain text tokens will be migrated on next login\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers upgrading to v2.29.0+ may not understand why their session token storage location changed or how to troubleshoot keyring-related issues. Admins need to know about this security improvement when planning upgrades and supporting users.\n\n## Links\n\n- Breaking change in v2.29.0: https://github.com/coder/coder/releases/tag/v2.29.0\n- Related PR: #20256, #20613, #20851\n- CLI reference already documents `--use-keyring` flag: https://coder.com/docs/reference/cli",

This prevents workspaces from showing as \"unhealthy\" when a devcontainer rebuilds and its sub-agent temporarily disconnects. Users should understand:\n\n1. **What happens during a devcontainer rebuild**: The sub-agent temporarily disconnects while the container is being rebuilt\n2. **Health status behavior**: The workspace will remain showing as \"healthy\" during devcontainer rebuilds because sub-agents don't affect workspace health\n3. **Why this matters**: Previously, devcontainer rebuilds would cause the entire workspace to appear unhealthy, which was confusing to users\n\nThis should be documented in context with other devcontainer lifecycle information so users understand what to expect when rebuilding their devcontainers.\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers need to understand workspace health behavior when using devcontainers to avoid confusion during rebuilds. Without documentation:\n- Users may be uncertain whether their workspace is actually healthy during a devcontainer rebuild\n- Support questions may arise about why health status behaves differently with devcontainers\n- Users may not understand the relationship between sub-agents and workspace health\n\n## Links\n\n- PR that changed behavior: https://github.com/coder/coder/pull/21098\n- Related devcontainer docs rewrite (in progress): https://github.com/coder/coder/pull/21080\n- Thread where this request originated: https://codercom.slack.com/archives/D0A1DVC2B8S/p1764888926119129",

Should include:\n  - Overview of what the workflow does (automated AI code review on PRs)\n  - How to trigger it (adding the \"code-review\" label or manual workflow dispatch)\n  - What to expect (inline comments with suggestions, GitHub suggestion syntax)\n  - Required secrets configuration (CODER_URL, CODER_SESSION_TOKEN)\n  - GitHub permissions needed\n  - Example of what a review looks like\n  - Troubleshooting common issues\n\n### \u2705 Updates Needed\n- **[docs/ai-coder/github-to-tasks.md](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/docs/ai-coder/github-to-tasks.md)** - Add a new section or example about the code review workflow as another use case for GitHub-to-Coder-Tasks integration. Currently it only covers issue triage/bug fixing, but this PR adds a PR review use case.\n\n- **docs/manifest.json** - Add the new code review workflow doc to the navigation structure under the \"ai-coder\" section, likely near the existing \"github-to-tasks.md\" entry.\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Rationale\nThis PR introduces a significant new user-facing feature: an automated AI code review workflow that developers can trigger on their PRs. The workflow:\n1. Creates a Coder Task to review PR changes\n2. Posts inline comments with committable suggestions using GitHub's native suggestion syntax\n3. Provides a comprehensive review with categorized findings\n\nThis is a complete, production-ready workflow that users will want to adopt, so it needs clear documentation explaining how to set it up and use it effectively.\n\n---\n*This comment was generated by an AI Agent through [Coder Tasks](https://coder.com/docs/ai-coder/tasks)*",

Should explain:\n  - How to enable and use the code-review workflow\n  - Prerequisites (GitHub external auth, secrets configuration)\n  - How the workflow analyzes PRs and posts inline suggestions\n  - Difference from the issue-based workflow in github-to-tasks.md\n  - Best practices for using AI code reviews\n\n### \u2705 Updates Needed\n- **[docs/ai-coder/github-to-tasks.md](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/docs/ai-coder/github-to-tasks.md)** - Add a reference/link to the new code review workflow document, since this is a related but distinct use case (PR review vs issue triage)\n- **[docs/manifest.json](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/docs/manifest.json)** - Add entry for the new code-review-workflow.md page under the ai-coder section\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Rationale\nThis PR adds a significant new user-facing feature: an automated AI code review workflow. Users will need documentation to:\n1. Understand how to set up and configure the workflow\n2. Learn how it differs from the existing issue-based Tasks workflow\n3. Configure the required secrets and permissions\n4. Understand the workflow's capabilities and limitations\n\n---\n*This comment was generated by an AI Agent through [Coder Tasks](https://coder.com/docs/ai-coder/tasks)*",

Post inline comments on SPECIFIC LINES where issues exist\n+            2. Use \\`\\`\\`suggestion syntax for every code change\n+            3. Each suggestion must be committable with one click\n+            4. Only include the lines that need to change in the suggestion block\n+            5. Make sure suggestion syntax is exactly: \\`\\`\\`suggestion (no language tag)\n+            6. Post summary comment after all inline comments are done\n+\n+          EXAMPLE INLINE COMMENT IN JSON:\n+            {\n+              \"path\": \"coderd/oauth2.go\",\n+              \"line\": 123,\n+              \"side\": \"RIGHT\",\n+              \"body\": \"**Issue:** Error not wrapped with context.

Review the ENTIRE diff before commenting\n+            2. Build the review.json file as you go\n+            3. Be helpful and concise - explain WHY briefly\n+            4. Prioritize: security > bugs > logic > style\n+            5. Style matters - flag inconsistencies with Coder codebase patterns\n+            6. Limit to 15-20 most important issues\n+            7. Summary should be 15-20 lines max\n+            8. Skip \"Highlights\" section if nothing exceptional\n+            9. Don't repeat inline comment details in summary\n+            10. Use \"COMMENT\" event (neutral feedback)\n+            11. Validate JSON before submitting: jq . review.json\n+\n+          COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:\n+            - Don't be overly verbose - summary should be 15-20 lines\n+            - Don't write paragraphs explaining obvious issues\n+            - Don't include \"Highlights\" if nothing is exceptional\n+            - Don't use language tags in suggestion blocks (no \\`\\`\\`go)\n+            - Don't forget to get the commit SHA first\n+            - Don't post individual comments - batch in ONE review\n+            - Don't ignore style issues that break Coder conventions\n+            - Don't suggest identical code (verify before/after differ)\n+            - Don't repeat the same issue multiple times\n+\n+          ERROR HANDLING:\n+            Before submitting the review:\n+            1. Validate JSON syntax: jq . review.json\n+            2. Check that GH_TOKEN is set: echo \\$GH_TOKEN\n+            3. Verify commit SHA is valid: echo \\$COMMIT_SHA\n+            4. Test API access: gh api user --jq '.login'\n+\n+            If gh api fails:\n+            1. Check error message for specific issue\n+            2. Verify file paths are relative to repo root (no leading /)\n+            3. Ensure line numbers exist in the PR diff\n+            4. Check that side=\"RIGHT\" for changed code\n+            5. As last resort, post a summary comment explaining the findings\n+\n+          EOF\n+          )\n+\n+          # Output the prompt\n+          {\n+            echo \"task_prompt<<EOFOUTPUT\"\n+            echo \"${TASK_PROMPT}\"\n+            echo \"EOFOUTPUT\"\n+          } >> \"${GITHUB_OUTPUT}\"\n+\n+      - name: Checkout create-task-action\n+        uses: actions/checkout@1af3b93b6815bc44a9784bd300feb67ff0d1eeb3 # v6.0.0\n+        with:\n+          fetch-depth: 1\n+          path: ./.github/actions/create-task-action\n+          persist-credentials: false\n+          ref: main",

Overall, this is a **well-structured implementation** with excellent documentation and clear intent. The workflow logic is sound and the prompt engineering is comprehensive.\n\n### Summary\nThis PR adds a new GitHub Actions workflow that triggers AI-powered code reviews via Coder Tasks. The workflow can be triggered by adding a \"code-review\" label to a PR or via manual dispatch. It builds a comprehensive prompt for the AI agent and creates a Coder task to perform the review.\n\n### \u2705 Strengths\n- **Excellent inline documentation** explaining the workflow's purpose, triggers, and requirements\n- **Good conditional logic** handling both pull_request and workflow_dispatch events\n- **Proper permission scoping** with minimal required permissions (contents: read, pull-requests: write, actions: write)\n- **Comprehensive prompt engineering** with detailed instructions for the AI agent including examples\n- **Well-organized step structure** with clear naming and logical flow\n- **Good separation of concerns** between steps (determine context, build prompt, create task)\n\n### \ud83d\udcca Review Stats\n- High priority issues: 4 (error handling, security)\n- Medium priority issues: 3 (shell scripting best practices)\n- Low priority suggestions: 2 (reproducibility, clarity)\n\n### \ud83d\udd12 Security & Error Handling\nThe main improvements needed:\n1. **Add `set -euo pipefail`** to all shell script blocks for proper error handling\n2. **Validate user input** (PR URLs) before processing to prevent injection\n3. **Quote variables** properly to handle special characters safely\n4. **Improve error messages** with more actionable context\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Testing Notes\n- The workflow structure is sound and should work as designed\n- Consider testing with edge cases: malformed URLs, special characters, draft PRs\n- The 30-minute timeout is reasonable for code review tasks\n- Good use of `comment-on-issue: false` since AI posts review directly\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Additional Recommendations\n- **Pin action versions** to commit SHAs for reproducibility (line 352)\n- Consider adding retry logic for transient API failures\n- Document what happens when `template_preset` is empty\n\n---\n*This review was generated by an AI Agent through [Coder Tasks](https://coder.com/docs/ai-coder/tasks)*",

Check Against Project Standards\n+               - Review against Uber Go Style Guide (for Go code)\n+               - Check commit message format\n+               - Verify proper comments (explain why, not what)\n+               - Ensure no unnecessary changes to unrelated code\n+               - Check for proper line wrapping (80 chars for comments)\n+\n+            7. Create ONE review with ALL inline comments using GitHub's review API\n+               CRITICAL: Submit everything as a single review, not separate comments\n+\n+            8.

Post inline comments on SPECIFIC LINES where issues exist\n+            2. Use \\`\\`\\`suggestion syntax for every code change\n+            3. Each suggestion must be committable with one click\n+            4. Only include the lines that need to change in the suggestion block\n+            5. Make sure suggestion syntax is exactly: \\`\\`\\`suggestion (no language tag)\n+            6. Post summary comment after all inline comments are done\n+\n+          EXAMPLE INLINE COMMENT IN JSON:\n+            {\n+              \"path\": \"coderd/oauth2.go\",\n+              \"line\": 123,\n+              \"side\": \"RIGHT\",\n+              \"body\": \"**Issue:** Error not wrapped with context.

Review the ENTIRE diff before starting to comment\n+            2. Build the review.json file as you go through the code\n+            3. Be constructive - explain WHY, not just WHAT\n+            4. Prioritize critical issues (security, bugs) over style\n+            5. Use \"COMMENT\" event for suggestions (not REQUEST_CHANGES)\n+            6. If the review is too large (>20 comments), focus on most important\n+            7. Include positive feedback in strengths section\n+            8. Make suggestions actionable and specific\n+            9. Validate JSON syntax before submitting (use jq . review.json)\n+            10. Test with a small review first if unsure\n+\n+          COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:\n+            - Don't use language tags in suggestion blocks (no \\`\\`\\`go)\n+            - Don't forget to get the commit SHA first\n+            - Don't post individual comments - batch them in ONE review\n+            - Don't use -f for line numbers, use -F (uppercase)\n+            - Don't comment on unchanged lines (use side=\"RIGHT\")\n+            - Don't include more context than needed in suggestion blocks\n+            - Don't suggest changes to test files that mock prod behavior\n+            - Don't nitpick formatting if it follows project style\n+\n+          ERROR HANDLING:\n+            Before submitting the review:\n+            1. Validate JSON syntax: jq . review.json\n+            2. Check that GH_TOKEN is set: echo \\$GH_TOKEN\n+            3. Verify commit SHA is valid: echo \\$COMMIT_SHA\n+            4. Test API access: gh api user --jq '.login'\n+\n+            If gh api fails:\n+            1. Check error message for specific issue\n+            2. Verify file paths are relative to repo root (no leading /)\n+            3. Ensure line numbers exist in the PR diff\n+            4. Check that side=\"RIGHT\" for changed code\n+            5. As last resort, post a summary comment explaining the findings\n+\n+          EOF\n+          )\n+\n+          # Output the prompt\n+          {\n+            echo \"task_prompt<<EOFOUTPUT\"\n+            echo \"${TASK_PROMPT}\"\n+            echo \"EOFOUTPUT\"\n+          } >> \"${GITHUB_OUTPUT}\"\n+\n+      - name: Checkout create-task-action\n+        uses: actions/checkout@1af3b93b6815bc44a9784bd300feb67ff0d1eeb3 # v6.0.0\n+        with:\n+          fetch-depth: 1\n+          path: ./.github/actions/create-task-action\n+          persist-credentials: false\n+          ref: main\n+          repository: coder/create-task-action\n+\n+      - name: Create Coder Task for Code Review\n+        id: create_task\n+        uses: ./.github/actions/create-task-action\n+        with:\n+          coder-url: ${{ secrets.DOC_CHECK_CODER_URL }}\n+          coder-token: ${{ secrets.DOC_CHECK_CODER_SESSION_TOKEN }}\n+          coder-organization: \"default\"\n+          coder-template-name: coder\n+          coder-template-preset: ${{ steps.determine-context.outputs.template_preset }}\n+          coder-task-name-prefix: code-review\n+          coder-task-prompt: ${{ steps.build-prompt.outputs.task_prompt }}\n+          github-user-id: ${{ steps.determine-context.outputs.github_user_id }}",

Review the ENTIRE diff before starting to comment\n+            2. Build the review.json file as you go through the code\n+            3. Be constructive - explain WHY, not just WHAT\n+            4. Prioritize critical issues (security, bugs) over style\n+            5. Use \"COMMENT\" event for suggestions (not REQUEST_CHANGES)\n+            6. If the review is too large (>20 comments), focus on most important\n+            7. Include positive feedback in strengths section\n+            8. Make suggestions actionable and specific\n+            9. Validate JSON syntax before submitting (use jq . review.json)\n+            10. Test with a small review first if unsure\n+\n+          COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:\n+            - Don't use language tags in suggestion blocks (no \\`\\`\\`go)\n+            - Don't forget to get the commit SHA first\n+            - Don't post individual comments - batch them in ONE review\n+            - Don't use -f for line numbers, use -F (uppercase)\n+            - Don't comment on unchanged lines (use side=\"RIGHT\")\n+            - Don't include more context than needed in suggestion blocks\n+            - Don't suggest changes to test files that mock prod behavior\n+            - Don't nitpick formatting if it follows project style\n+\n+          ERROR HANDLING:\n+            Before submitting the review:\n+            1. Validate JSON syntax: jq . review.json\n+            2. Check that GH_TOKEN is set: echo \\$GH_TOKEN\n+            3. Verify commit SHA is valid: echo \\$COMMIT_SHA\n+            4. Test API access: gh api user --jq '.login'\n+\n+            If gh api fails:\n+            1. Check error message for specific issue\n+            2. Verify file paths are relative to repo root (no leading /)\n+            3. Ensure line numbers exist in the PR diff\n+            4. Check that side=\"RIGHT\" for changed code\n+            5. As last resort, post a summary comment explaining the findings\n+\n+          EOF\n+          )\n+\n+          # Output the prompt\n+          {\n+            echo \"task_prompt<<EOFOUTPUT\"\n+            echo \"${TASK_PROMPT}\"\n+            echo \"EOFOUTPUT\"\n+          } >> \"${GITHUB_OUTPUT}\"\n+\n+      - name: Checkout create-task-action\n+        uses: actions/checkout@1af3b93b6815bc44a9784bd300feb67ff0d1eeb3 # v6.0.0",
